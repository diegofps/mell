# When should I use Mell

## Use it when ‚≠ê

Sometimes it is useful to render an entire project, not only an e-mail or a single webpage, like in a webserver response. This is when mell comes to help. So far, I have used it in the following situations:

* Generating VHDL code for a static neural network, variating a few parameters. Mell is much more flexible than the generic atributes available in the language.
* Generating model classes for an ORM. I defined the model classes and relations as metadata and asked mell to generate them for me in C#.
* Generating resumes to send to job applications. I use latex to generate my resume. Instead of changing multiple configuration files in my latex project I change only a single metadata file, customizing the letter, company name, color, and so on. Mell generates a latex source that I compile to PDF.

Conceptually, you may use mell in two directions. A metadata used with multiple styles, representing different projections of the same thing, or a single style used by multiple metadata, creating different things with the same look. 

As an example, consider the situation that we have metadata describing a mobile app and a style that can render an Android app. We could change the metadata and generate different Android apps, or we could change the style and render the same app on different platforms, like an IOS app.


## Think twice when üöß

I don't recommend using this if you are not confortable programming in the stack you are generating code to, as the template files may elevate your project complexity. This works better if are at a point where you feel like everything is just the same with a few different parameters. These few parameters will likely become your metadata when you use mell.

You may constantly find that mell may be replaced by reflection or similar concepts on your programming language of choice. This is true and the answer to "which of them is better?" depends on your requirements. Mell may be more efficient as many logic rules are evaluated during rendering time, whereas reflection adds more complexity during the program execution. However, reflection is also simpler and more flexible during runtime. Mell is also more suitable to generate configuration files based on global parameters, like a kubernetes' configuration file or a django's settings.
